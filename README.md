## About us

This repository represents a coordinated effort of the IMBEI research fellows, spearheaded by the Biostatistics Division.

During active semesters we hold weekly meetings, where a chapter of a book is presented by [] with a focus on modern applied statistical methodology and using the R language. 

Our meetings are open to all (see details below), and materials we produce are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License. 

Honoring the license itself of the very source of inspiration for the structure of this repo, we acknowledge the repo from  the Waldron Lab https://github.com/waldronlab/data-science-seminar.

We hope you find these materials useful and will join our sessions.

## Getting started

1. Leave a comment on the ["Welcome" Issue](https://github.com/imbeimainz/MachineLearningClub/issues/1) to introduce yourself and to let us know your GitHub username.

2. Install R and RStudio (latest stable versions are very fine for this) - highly recommended for adopting the framework to create, edit, and further develop the reading/presentation materials.

3. Install RMarkdown and knitr, and get familiar with them - no pro knowledge is needed, although the more the merrier; plus, of course, these tools are potentially a huge productivity boost in many of your activities, so they are highly recommended

4. Install git and get familiar with GitHub. 
  Sign up for a GitHub account, then introduce yourself on the "Welcome" issue of this repository, under [Issues](https://github.com/imbeimainz/MachineLearningClub/issues). 
  You will then be able to contribute your presentation and/or exercise notes using file upload directly here, or by using git. 
  If you want to use git instead of simple file upload but don't know what that means, follow this [tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
  The process in RStudio is documented [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) or there is a video
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).



## Presenting

1. Pick the date or topic that best suits you and reserve it on the [presentation schedule wiki](https://github.com/imbeimainz/MachineLearningClub/wiki), adding your name/GitHub username to the schedule table.

2. Read the required section of the book, and do the associated exercises that you will present.

3. Edit the presentation file, using [the template provided](https://github.com/imbeimainz/MachineLearningClub/tree/master/presentation_template), and place it in the folder corresponding to the textbook name (and respective chapter). 
  See more information about making [Xaringan presentations](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/). 

4. Commit the presentation to GitHub so that it is available to others. 
  Don't know what that means? The process is documented [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) or there is a video
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).
