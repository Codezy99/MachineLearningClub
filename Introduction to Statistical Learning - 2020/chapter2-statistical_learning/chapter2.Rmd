#2.1  What Is Statistical Learning?

Motivating example: company wants to increase sales of a product.
* not possible directly
* but advertising expenditure can be controlled
* three advertising channels
  + TV
  + Radio
  + Newspapers
  
So there we have
* *output variable* we want to predict
  + $Y$ Sales
  + other terms: *response*, *dependent variable*
* *input variables* we can control 
  + $X_1$ TV budget
  + $X_2$ Radio budget
  + $X_3$ Newspapers budget
  + other terms: *predictors*,*independent variables*, *features*

---
#2.1  What Is Statistical Learning?
General aim: find a function $f$ that allows to predict $Y$ given $X_1, \ldots, X_p$
$$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$
with

$f$ fixed but unknown function of $X_1, \ldots, X_p$

$\epsilon$ *random error* term, independent of $X$ with mean zero

$f$ represents *systematic information* on $Y$ provided by $X$

# How are sales related to advertising?

```{r advertise_2a, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 12}
par(mfcol=c(1,3))

plot(x = TV, y = sales, col="red", 
     cex=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis = 1.5)
TV.reg <-lm(sales ~ TV, data = Advertising)
abline(coef = TV.reg$coefficients, col="blue",lwd=2)

plot(x = radio, y = sales, col="red", 
     cex=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis = 1.5)
radio.reg <-lm(sales ~ radio, data = Advertising)

# My first slide

- an elencation item
- another item

Normal text

Some Latex stuff because we could need it $x_2$

## Subheader

### h3-levels

`code formatting`

# A new slide

Where content shows up incrementally

--

like that

and that

---

# You can put some R code

like this

```{r}
set.seed(42)
fortunes::fortune()
```

---

# More R code

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```
