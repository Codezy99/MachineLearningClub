# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification of the Feature Space

1. We divide the predictor space - that is, the set of possible values for `\(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{p}\)` into `\(J\)` distinct and non-overlapping regions, `\(R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{J}\)`.

--

2. For every observation that falls into the region `\(R_{j}\)`, we make the same
prediction, which is simply the mean of the response values for the
training observations in `\(R_{j}\)`.

---

# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification of the Feature Space

## How to find regions in regression trees?

Find regions `\(R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{J}\)` such that the residual sum of squares (RSS) is minimized
`$$RSS = \sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{i \in R_{j}}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{j}}\right)^{2}$$`

---


# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification

## General Decision Tree Problem

* Choose __uncertainty measure__ (e.g. RSS, Gini index etc.)

* __Partition prediction space__ such that uncertainty measure is minimized

* Possible side conditions:
  * Minimize overall number of nodes
  * Minimize number of terminal nodes
  * Minimize tree depth
  * Minimize average tree depth

--

Trying to find the optimal partition of the prediction space is a combinatorial problem `\(\rightarrow\)` _number of possible partitions_ that one would have to try out _grows extremely fast_ with growing `\(J\)`. That means you will probably have to wait for a long time for the algorithm to finish...

---

# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification

## 'CART' Approach

* Makes use of a __top-down__, __greedy__ aproach `\(\rightarrow\)` _recursive binary splitting_:

  * Start from the top
  
  * Evaluate the problem greedily: "I will choose the split that gives me the best result right now, completely disregarding all possible future steps."
  
  * The greedy approach is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution

---

# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification

## 'CART' Approach Details

* Select predictor `\(X_j\)` and cutpoint `\(s\)` and create the regions
`\(R_{1}(j, s)=\left\{X | X_{j}&lt;s\right\}\)` and `\(R_{2}(j, s)=\left\{X | X_{j} \geq s\right\}\)`

* find the `\(j\)`, `\(s\)` that minimize 
`$$\sum_{i: x_{i} \in R_{1}(j, s)}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{1}}\right)^{2}+\sum_{i: x_{i} \in R_{2}(j, s)}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{2}}\right)^{2}$$`
`\(\hat{y}_{R_{1}}\)` is the mean response for the training observations in `\(R_{1}(j, s)\)` and `\(\hat{y}_{R_{2}}\)` is the mean response for the training observations in `\(R_{2}(j, s)\)`

---

# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification

## 'CART' Approach Details

* Split by best predictor and cutpoint

* Continue splitting in new regions (recursively)

* Finish if no region contains more than 5 observations

* Predict the response for a given test observation using the mean of the training observations in the region to which that test observation belongs

---

# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification

## Problem: Overfitting

* Too many splits could lead to __overfitting__

"A smaller tree with fewer splits (that is, fewer regions `\(R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{J}\)`) might lead to lower variance and better interpretation at the cost of a little bias."

Solution: __Pruning__

---

# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification

## Cost complexity pruning

* Introduce `\(\alpha\)` as a parameter for controlling the number of regions and fit of a tree to the training data
* `\(\alpha\)` is non-negative, and each value of `\(\alpha\)` represents a tree for which 
`$$\sum_{m=1}^{|T|} \sum_{i: x_{i} \in R_{m}}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{m}}\right)^{2}+\alpha|T|$$`
is __minimal__. `\(|T|\)` is the number of terminal nodes, `\(R_m\)` is the region corresponding the the `\(m\)`th terminal node, `\(\hat{y}_{R_{m}}\)` is the mean response for the training observations in `\(R_{m}\)`

`\(\rightarrow\)` a larger `\(\alpha\)` has a punishing effect and more branches will be pruned.

* The optimal `\(\hat{\alpha}\)`, representing the tree with the lowest uncertainty measure, is determined using cross-validation

&lt;/div&gt;

# 8.1.1 Prediction via Stratification

## CART Algorithm with cost complexity pruning

1. Use recursive binary splitting to grow a large tree on the training data, stopping only when each terminal node has fewer than some minimum number of observations.
2. Apply cost complexity pruning to the large tree in order to obtain a sequence of best subtrees, as a function of `\(\alpha\)`.
3. Use K-fold cross-validation to choose `\(\alpha\)`. For each `\(k=1, \ldots, K\)`:

  3.1. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 on the `\(\frac{K-1}{K}\)`th fraction of the training data, excluding the `\(k\)`th fold.
  
  3.2. Evaluate the mean squared prediction error on the data in the left-out `\(k\)`th fold, as a function of `\(\alpha\)`.
  
  Average the results, and pick `\(\alpha\)` to minimize the average error.
4. Return the subtree from Step 2 that corresponds to the chosen value of `\(\alpha\)`.

MSE values of the regression trees from the 'Hitters' data with varying values of `\(\alpha\)`. Standard error bands are displayed. 

---

# 8.1.2 Classification Trees
* Very similar to a regression tree, except that it is used to predict a qualitative response rather than a quantitative one.

* For a classification tree, we predict that each observation belongs to the _most commonly occurring class_ of training observations in the region to which it belongs.


&lt;img src="images/8_7.PNG" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# 8.1.2 Classification Trees

* Algorithm to construct a classification tree is almost identical to constructing a regression tree 
* Instead of RSS other measures are required.
* Examples:

Classification error rate:
`$$E=1-\max _{k}\left(\hat{p}_{m k}\right)$$`
Gini index:
`$$G=\sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{m k}\left(1-\hat{p}_{m k}\right)$$`
Entropy:
`$$D=-\sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{m k} \log \hat{p}_{m k}$$`

# 8.1.3 Trees Versus Linear Models

# 8.1.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Trees

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|-----|
| Trees are very easy to explain to people. In fact, they are even easier to explain than linear regression! | Unfortunately, trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches seen in this book. |
| Some people believe that decision trees more closely mirror human decision-making than do the regression and classification approaches seen in previous chapters. | Additionally, trees can be very non-robust. In other words, a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree. |
| Trees can be displayed graphically, and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert (especially if they are small). | - |
| Trees can easily handle qualitative predictors without the need to create dummy variables. | - |

# 8.2.1 Bagging

## Improving predictive accuracy

* Bootstrap subsets from training data
* Train tree using one of the `\(B\)` bootstrapped training sets to get `\(\hat{f}^{* b}(x)\)`
* Average all predictions at point `\(x\)`:
`$$\hat{f}_{\mathrm{bag}}(x)=\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \hat{f}^{* b}(x)$$`
* For classification trees: for each test observation, we record the class predicted by each of the B trees, and take a _majority vote_

* Bagging reduces variance compared to unpruned trees and produces less bias compared to pruned trees

---

# 8.2.1 Bagging
&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/8.8-1.png" alt="Bagging and random forest results for the 'Heart' data. The test error (black and orange) is shown as a function of B, the number of bootstrapped training sets used. Bagging improves the test error slightly." width="55%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Bagging and random forest results for the 'Heart' data. The test error (black and orange) is shown as a function of B, the number of bootstrapped training sets used. Bagging improves the test error slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# 8.2.2 Random Forests

* __Idea:__ reduce correlation between trees to reduce variance even more

* when building the decision trees on bootstrapped training samples only a random sample of `\(m\)` predictors is chosen

* mostly, `\(m \approx \sqrt{p}\)`

---

# 8.2.2 Random Forests
&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/8.10-1.png" alt="Test error for increasing number of random forests. Data is 15-class gene expression data. " width="60%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Test error for increasing number of random forests. Data is 15-class gene expression data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
As with bagging, random forests will not overfit if we increase `\(B\)`, so in
practice we use a value of `\(B\)` sufficiently large for the error rate to
have settled down.

---

# 8.2.3 Boosting
* grow trees __sequentially__: each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees

* each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set

  * instead of fitting the tree to the outcome `\(Y\)`, a __new tree is fitted on the residuals__ obtained from the previous step
  
  * the __number of terminal nodes__ is determined by the parameter `\(d\)`, and the trees are rather __small__
  
  * the new tree is then added to the previous function, weighted with a __shrinkage parameter__ `\(\lambda\)`
  
  * the residuals are updated

---

## 8.2.3 Boosting algorithm for regression trees
1. Set `\(\hat{f}(x)=0\)` and `\(r_{i}=y_{i}\)` for all `\(i\)` in the training set.
2. For `\(b=1,2, \ldots, B\)`, repeat:
  
  2.1 Fit a tree `\(\hat{f}^{b}\)` with `\(d\)` splits ( `\(d + 1\)` terminal nodes) to the training data `\((X, r)\)`.
  
  2.2 Update `\(\hat{f}^{b}\)` by adding in a shrunken version of the new tree:
  `$$\hat{f}(x) \leftarrow \hat{f}(x)+\lambda \hat{f}^{b}(x)$$`
  2.3 Update the residuals,
  `$$r_{i} \leftarrow r_{i}-\lambda \hat{f}^{b}\left(x_{i}\right)$$`
3. Output the boosted model,

`$$\hat{f}(x)=\sum_{b=1}^{B} \lambda \hat{f}^{b}(x)$$`

---

# 8.2.3 Boosting
&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/8.11-1.png" alt="Test error performing boosting for an increasing number of trees. Data is 15-class gene expression data. " width="60%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Test error performing boosting for an increasing number of trees. Data is 15-class gene expression data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Depth-1 trees slightly outperform depth-2 trees, and both outperform the
random forest.
