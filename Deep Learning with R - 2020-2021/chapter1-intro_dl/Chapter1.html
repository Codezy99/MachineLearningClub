# Motivations: applications


- near-human-level image classification, speech recognition, hand-writing transcription
- improved machine translation
- improved text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion
- digital assistants like Google Now, Amazon Alexa
- autonomous driving
- improved ad-targeting
- improved search results
- ability to answer natural language questions


---

# AI visions

- medical diagnosis
- assistant,  or even friend
- answer questions
- help in education
- grocery deliveries
- driving

# What is AI, machine learning and deep learning?

Artificial intelligence: 

- field that attempts to make machines "think" like human beings
- simulate "learning" and "problem-solving"
- efforts to automate tasks normally done by humans


---

# What is AI, machine learning and deep learning?

Machine learning: 

- subfield of AI
- algorithms that improve through experience/training data
- searching for a useful representation of input data (with a predefined space of possibilities: hypothesis space), using guidance from a feedback signal

---

# What is AI, machine learning and deep learning?

Deep learning: 

- subfield of machine learning
- based on neural network, with successive layers of increasingly meaningful data representations

---

# What is AI, machine learning and deep learning?


## What is the overall challenge?

- computers good at problems that can be described by formal rules
- challenge: tasks that require intuition (e.g. we humans do not know how we understand/recognize words or faces), requires an immense knowledge about the world
- Turing test: can a person figure out whether she/he is interacting with another human being or with a machine?

---

# What is AI, machine learning and deep learning?

## Philosophical questions

- Can a computer automatically learn rules from underlying data?

- What is intelligence?

---

# What is AI, machine learning and deep learning?

- classical program: input: rules and data, output: answers
- machine learning: input: data, answers, output: rules

- think of machine learning as a transformation of data

- deep learning: (long) sequence of simple transformations

---

# How does deep learning work?

![layers](figs/layers.png)  

---

# How does deep learning work?

- overall process: transformation of the data
- each data representation is considered a layer
- a simple transformation between two consecutive layers is given a collection of weights/parameters
- learning consists of finding the "best" values for the weights of all layers
- this optimization is based on the loss function/objective function
- use of backpropagation algorithm

deep learning and neural networks are inspired by but NOT models of the brain

# History

- dreams of AI can be traced back to ancient Greece
- Ada Lovelace, collaborator of Charles Babbage, develops Analytical Engine in 1843: meant to assist with computations that humans know how to do
- in 1950s: Alan Turing publishes article Computing Machinery and Intelligence and proposed the Turing test
- in the beginning (1950-80s): there was a belief in hard-coded rules/symbolic AI
- knowledge-base approach: hard-code knowledge in formal languages

---

# History

- there were several rounds of cuts of funding/ AI winters: high expectations led to failures to deliver and then to funding cuts
- IBM Deep Blue chess-playing system beats world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 (using symbolic AI/brute-force search)


---


# History

- already in 1950s toy models of neural nets
- roots in statistics: Naive Bayes algorithm, logistic regression
- in 1980s: backpropagation algorithm, gradient descent algorithm
- in 1989 Yann LeCun at BellLabs develops LeNet network, later used by US postal service to automate reading hand-written ZIP codes



---

# History


- in early 1990s, successes and popularity of kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM)
- modern formulation of SVMs by Vladimir Vapnik and Corinna Cortes
- key idea: find a hyperplane separating the data in a high-dimensional representation space

---

# History

- use of kernel trick: use a kernel function as a similarity measure/metric in the high-dimensional space, rather than computing transformation into high-dim representation space
- pros: extensive theory
- cons: not scalable, bad at perceptual tasks like image classification

---


# History


- in 2000s: decision trees for classification, according to tree/question-structure

- random forest algorithm

- in 2014, gradient boosting machines best for non-perceptual tasks


---

# History

- in 2010s: neural nets have replaced SVMs again
- competitions push and accelerate progress, e.g. Kaggle.com
- in 2013 google acquires DeepMind for 500 million dollars

---

# History


- super-human Go-playing:
- in 2015-16 AlphaGo beats Fan Hui and Lee Sedol
- in 2017, AlphaGo Zero, self-taught by playing games against itself, without using data from human games
- Deep Mind wants to apply AlphaGo algorithms to protein folding

- AI today may be compared to Internet in 1995



---

# Why deep learning?

- better performance (since 2010s, with more than 10 layers)

- simplicity: no need for feature engineering

- scalability: parallelization possible

- versatility and reusability, e.g. can be trained on additional data without having to start from scratch; repurposable: e.g. image classification network can be used in video processing pipeline

---

# Why deep learning?

progress depended on: 

-hardware; computing power increase due to gaming industry, e.g. NVIDIA, AMD

-data sets and benchmarks; sources for data: flickr, YouTube, wikipedia (for natural-language processing, ImageNet data set: 1.4 million images in 1000 categories)

-algorithmic advances
